            As I indicated in the Popular Ramen Varieties page, my next step was to see what brands were the most reviewed. After running the analysis for this section, I do have to admit that the brands that appeared at the top are all brands that I like to eat. For this graph, I used the dataframe I created to hold the information just for the United States and grouped it by brands. This new dataframe would hold the the total reviews for each brand. I then choose to visualize the results in a horizontal bar graph with the top bar being the most reviewed/popular brand to the least reviewed. As I indicated above, I was not surprised at the return from this graph since the top brands are all popular brands you see at the supermarket. Howver, now seeing the the other reviewed brands in this graph, I will have a few new ramens to track down and try.
