Web Design Homework - HTML & CSS

I choose to take the challenge presented in the bonus section and create new visualizations from an external dataset. I found a simple csv dataset on kaggle.com that collected review scores for Ramen, which can be found in the resources folder. So, my webpage is dedicated to the very delcious Ramen noodle. 

Inside my repo, you will find ramen_analysis.ipynb file which contains the analysis I performed for the visualization portion of the webpage. There may be a couple of graphs that were found in the jupyter notebook but did not make the cut for the webpage. Please note that I commented out the plt.savefig lines that saved images. You will find those images stored in the folder named visualizations.

Inside the assests folder, you will find 2 more folders. The first named images stores the images that I used or considered using at one time during the project. The second folder named pandas_html_tables holds a copy of the ramen dataframe transformed into html for the data page of my website. Also stored in this folder is a plotly/javascript file which I used to create an interactive graph for my homepage. 

** Please note, I had no idea that the interactive graph would contain so much code. It will make the index.html file run run slow but it works and I am very satisfied with the end result. **

The rest of the repo is pretty straight foward. All of the html files on the same level as the folders make up my website. When I was designing the website, I was using a large screen which will explain why some of the graphs are to large for smaller screens. 

I know that media queries were an important part of making this website more responsive and would have fixed the display issue you will most likely experience. I unfortunately ran out of time and with one more day to test the media queries, I know the website would have been a decent experience.

I had a lot of fun with this assignment and I am happy with what I was able to present to you. Thank you and I hope you enjoy the product!
